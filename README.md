# The Wedding Planner

*You just got engaged! Now you have 12 months to plan the wedding of your dreams.*

**The Wedding Planner** is a medium-weight strategy game that captures the authentic pressure of the process: an overwhelming workload, finite resources, and the constant tension between vision and reality. Each turn, you choose one simple action: **Research**, **Book**, **Plan**, or **Help**, building toward your ceremony while decisions compound and your options narrow.

At the heart of the game is your 3×3 vendor grid. Every booking triggers cascading effects: advancing theme trackers, unlocking ceremony Moments, and fueling guest excitement. But each placement is permanent, and every vendor you commit to closes doors elsewhere. Will you chase an *"Unforgettable"* 30-point theme or hedge toward safer goals?

There is never enough time, never enough money, and never a perfect solution. There are only the hard choices between the wedding you want and the wedding you can pull off, even with the support of family and friends.

*From the initial "Yes!" to the final "I do!" every wedding tells a story. What will yours be?*
