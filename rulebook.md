## 3. SETUP

Follow these steps in order:

### Shared Setup

**1. Place Game Board**
Place the Game Board in the center of the table, accessible to everyone.

**2. Place Research Board**
Place the Research Board in the center of the table, accessible to everyone.

**3. Prepare Vendor Decks**
Shuffle all 9 vendor category decks separately. Place them face-down on the Research board in their designated category spaces.

**4. Prepare Venue Deck**
Shuffle all 12 venue cards and place face-down on the Research Board in the Venue space.
>**Competitive Venue Variant (Advanced):**
Use the provided 2nd copy of each standard venue in the venue deck (24 venues total). Once a Venue is booked, the other copy of the exact same venue is immediately unavailable and removed from the game, even if it is in a player's hand.

**5. Prepare Research Deck**
Shuffle the Research cards and place face-down on the Research space.

**6. Prepare Theme Deck**
Shuffle the Theme deck and place face-down near the play area.

**7. Prepare Help Decks**
Separate the 18 Help cards into three decks by type:
- **Money Help** (6 cards) - shuffle and place face-down on the Game Board
- **Effort Help** (6 cards) - shuffle and place face-down on the Game Board
- **Research Help** (6 cards) - shuffle and place face-down on the Game Board

**8. Reveal Moment Cards**
Separate the 16 Moment cards into three decks by size (Small, Medium, Large). Either:
- **Standard game:** Randomly draw 1 Small, 1 Medium, and 1 Large Moment
- **Advanced game:** Shuffle all Moment cards together and randomly draw 3 Moments 
> **First Game Tip:** Use *The Aisle*, *The Promise*, and *The Union*

Place the chosen Moments face-up (showing first completer values) on the Game Board.

**9. Reveal Award Cards**
Shuffle the 10 Award cards. Either:
- **Standard game:** Randomly draw 1 Race Award and 1 Endgame Award
> **First Game Tip:** Use *First to Excitement* and *Most Well-Rounded*

Place the chosen Awards face-up on the Game Board.

**10. Prepare Personality Deck**
Shuffle the Personality deck and place face-down near the play area.
> **First Game Tip:** - Skip Personalities entirely

### Player Setup

Each player performs these steps:

**1. Take Player Board**
Take a player board and place it in front of you.

**2. Take Task Worksheet**
Take a task worksheet and place it on your player board in the task area.

**3. Take a set of Goals**
Take a complete set of goals (theme, budget, excitement, and guest goals) and place them next to your player board.

**4. Draft Personality**
Shuffle the Personality deck. Each player draws 2 Personality cards, chooses 1, and discards the other face-down.

> **First Game Tip:** Skip Personalities entirely

**5. Receive Starting Coins**
Take your starting 12 coins.

**6. Draw Theme Cards**
Draw 2 Theme cards from the Theme deck. Keep both hidden from everyone. You'll choose 1 at the first Check-In.

**7. Receive a Wedding Planner Contract**
Draw 1 Wedding Planner Contract randomly. Place your Wedding Planner contract near your player board. You can contract with your planner later in the game if desired.

> **First Game Tip:** Skip Wedding Planner Contracts entirely

**8. Set Up Trackers**
- Place your **Theme Element Trackers** on position 0 of each theme element track on your player board
- Place your **Excitement Tracker** on position 0 of the excitement track on your player board
- Place your **Completed Tasks Tracker** on position 0 of the completed tasks track on your player board
- Place your **Meeple** on your Vision board area (starting position)

**9. Personality-Specific Setup**
- If playing with Personalities, follow the initial setup outlined on your chosen personality card. This may include a change to your starting coins, vendors in hand, initial progress toward tasks, excitement, or other modifications like hand-limit size, etc.

### Final Shared Steps

**1. Determine First Player**
The first player is the player whose wedding is the closest (either in the past or future). Alternatively, randomly determine the first player. Give them the First Player token.

**2. Initialize Timeline**
The first player takes the Timeline token and sets it to Month 1 on the timeline.

**3. Seed Featured Vendor Row**
The first player chooses 5 distinct vendor categories. Reveal 1 card from each chosen category and place face-up in the Featured Vendor Row at the bottom of the Research board. The Featured Vendor Row (FVR) is a shared display that may contain vendors and, later in the game, venues.

> **Note:** By default, everyone starts with no vendors in hand.

### Setup Complete!

Your table should now show:
- Game board in the center with 3 shared help decks, 3 Moment cards, 2 Award cards, and the Timeline token on Month 1
- Research board in center with category decks, venue deck, research deck, and 5 face-up cards in Featured Vendor Row
- Each player with board, a set of goals, meeple on Vision, trackers at 0, 2 Theme cards in hand, Wedding Planner contract visible, and starting coins.

The first player begins Month 1!

---

## 4. HOW TO PLAY

The Wedding Planner plays over **12 months** organized into **4 quarters**:
- **Q1:** Months 1-3
- **Q2:** Months 4-6
- **Q3:** Months 7-9
- **Q4:** Months 10-12

After months 3, 6, and 9, everyone participates in a **Check-In** before continuing to the next quarter.

### Turn Structure

On your turn:
1. **Choose and move to an action**
2. **Resolve the action**
3. **Resolve any bonus actions**
4. **Check hand limit** (end of turn)

#### 1. Choose and Move to an Action

Choose ONE of these four actions:
- **Research** - Acquire vendor or venue cards
- **Book** - Place a vendor or venue in your 3×3 grid
- **Plan** - Apply effort to tasks on your worksheet
- **Help** - Draw from a shared Help deck

**Move your meeple** to the chosen action's location:
- **Research:** On the shared Research board
- **Book:** On your player board
- **Plan:** On your player board
- **Help:** On the shared Game board

**Important:** You **must move your meeple** at the beginning of every month. Since you begin the game on your Vision board, you may choose any action during the first month.

**Bonus actions do NOT move your meeple**, so they don't affect what action you can perform during the next month.

#### 2. Resolve the Action

Follow the steps for your chosen action (see **Actions in Detail** section).

#### 3. Resolve Bonus Actions

Some effects grant **bonus actions** (Book, Plan, Help, or Research). When you take a bonus action:
- Do **not** move your meeple
- Resolve the action normally

#### 4. Check Hand Limit

At the end of your turn, you must meet the **hand limit**:
- **Default:** 5 cards total (vendors + venues combined)

**Venue-Specific Limits:**
- **Before booking a venue:** Maximum 3 venues in hand
- **After booking a venue:** Must discard all remaining venues from hand by end of turn

Discard excess cards face-up to the Featured Vendor Row.

### Quarters and Check-Ins

After everyone completes their turn for months 3, 6, and 9, perform a **Check-In** (see **Check-Ins** section).

After month 12, proceed directly to **End of Game** (no Check-In).

### Example Turn

*It's Month 5 and it's Jennifer's turn. Her meeple is currently on Plan. She has 3 vendors in hand and 8 coins.*

**1. Choose Action:** At the start of her turn, Jennifer must move her meeple, so she cannot Plan again while it is already on Plan. She instead chooses the Book action and moves her meeple to Book on her player board.

**2. Resolve Action:** Jennifer plays a 2-cost, 2-excitement Flowers & Decorations vendor (Nature + Elegance) from her hand, pays 2 coins, and places it in grid position 1 (top-left).
- She advances Nature +1 and Elegance +1 on her theme element trackers
- She gains +2 excitement and advances her excitement tracker
- She checks for completed Moments but sees no patterns completed

**3. Bonus Action:** Grid position 1 grants a Research bonus. Jennifer takes the Research action as a bonus (and does **not** move her meeple). She chooses to research from the Featured Vendor Row and takes 1 face-up vendor from the row that matches her theme and budget perfectly.

**4. Hand Limit:** Jennifer is now back to 3 vendors in hand (which is still under the 5-card limit). Her turn ends.

---

## 5. ACTIONS IN DETAIL

### Research Action

Acquire venue or vendor cards to your hand.

**Steps:**

**Choose ONE option:**

**Option 1: Featured Vendor Row**
Take 1 face-up card (vendor or venue) from the Featured Vendor Row (FVR) and add it to your hand.

**Option 2: Category Search**
Choose 1 vendor category or the Venue deck. Draw 2 face-down cards from that deck and add both to your hand.

**Option 3: Browse for Inspiration**
Flip the top Research card. It shows 4 vendor categories. Either
- Draw 1 vendor from each of those 4 categories
- Draw 1 vendor from 3 of those categories (you choose which 3) + draw 1 venue card.

> Note: If any of the 4 categories shown is empty, discard the Research card and flip a new one. Use the new card's 4 categories instead.

---

### Book Action

Place a vendor or venue from your hand into your 3×3 grid.

**Steps:**

**1. Choose a Card**
Select a vendor or venue card from your hand. You may alternatively book a vendor **face-down as DIY** (see sidebar).

**2. Pay the Cost**
- **Vendor:** Pay the cost shown on the vendor card (typically 1-3 coins)
- **Venue:** Pay the cost shown on the venue card (typically 2-4 coins)
- **DIY vendor:** Pay 0 coins
> Note: If you have an applicable discount, pay the discounted cost.

**3. Place in Grid**
Place the card in an empty position on your 3×3 grid:
- **The center position:** is reserved for the Venue
- **All other positions:** Any vendor (Venue not allowed)

Face-up bookings show the card face. DIY bookings are placed face-down showing only the category icon on the back.

**4. Gain Theme Elements**
For each theme element icon on the card:
- Advance that element's tracker by 1
- Check for milestones at positions 2, 5, and 8:
  - **Position 2 or 5:** Gain +1 excitement
  - **Position 8:** Gain 5 gifts immediately

**Venues also grant 1 wild theme token:** Choose any element tracker to advance by 1 (in addition to the printed icons).

**DIY vendors grant no theme elements.**

**5. Gain Excitement**
Gain the excitement printed on the card by advancing your excitement tracker. If you cross a milestone at positions 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25, choose one:
- Gain 1 coin, OR
- Draw 1 venue card from the venue deck or a vendor card from any category deck (top card)

**If contracted with your Wedding Planner:** You may instead draw from the Featured Vendor Row.

**DIY vendors grant no excitement.**

**6. Check Moments**
Check if your grid matches any revealed Moment pattern. If yes, score the Moment immediately (see **Moments** section).

**7. Resolve "When Booked" Effects**

Immediately take the bonus action shown on the grid space where you booked:
- **Positions 1, 9:** Research bonus
- **Positions 2, 8:** Plan bonus
- **Positions 3, 7:** Book bonus
- **Positions 4, 6:** Help bonus

**Fallbacks:**
- If forced to take a Book bonus but you cannot (no cards/no space): Gain +1 excitement instead
- If forced to take a Plan bonus but you cannot (no unlocked incomplete tasks): Gain +1 excitement instead
- If forced to take a Help bonus but you cannot (all three helpers already taken): Gain +1 excitement instead

> **DIY Bookings**
> 
> You may book any vendor **face-down as DIY** for 0 coins. This represents doing it yourself or getting help from family/friends instead of hiring a professional.
> 
> **DIY bookings:**
> - Cost 0 coins (free)
> - Grant no theme elements
> - Grant no excitement
> - Still trigger grid bonus actions
> - Still count for Moments, Guest Goals, and task completion
> - Do NOT count for Theme Goals, Budget Goals, or Excitement Goals

---

### Plan Action

Apply effort toward completing tasks on your visible worksheet.

**Steps:**

**1. Apply 3 Effort**
Distribute **3 effort marks** across any unlocked tasks on your worksheet. An unlocked task is one whose requirements are already met. A requirement can be either a key task, a required booking, or both. (A task with no requirements is unlocked by default.)

You may apply all 3 marks to a single task, or split them across multiple tasks.

**2. Complete Tasks**
When all effort boxes on a task are filled, the task immediately completes:
- **Award gifts:** Take gift tokens equal to the task's value
- **Advance Completed Tasks tracker:** Mark the next position on your tracker. If you hit a milestone, resolve the bonus immediately:
  - **Effort:** Apply 1 effort to any unlocked task
  - **Excitement:** Gain +1 excitement
  - **5 (gifts):** Gain 5 gifts
- **If key task:** Unlock all related tasks below it

**Key Tasks:**
Each key task conditionally unlocks three dependent tasks. Those tasks may still require a booking in order to be fully unlocked.
> **Note:** Key tasks can never be worked on by anyone other than you. (Not helpers or planners)
> 
Here's a list of the three key tasks:
- **Choose Wedding Party:** worth 1 gift when completed, requires 3 total effort. Completing this task additionally grants +1 excitement and immediately satisfies the Key requirement for:
  - *Host Rehearsal Dinner* (now unlocked)
  - *Host Post-Wedding Brunch* (now unlocked)
  - *Plan Wedding Party Processional* (now unlocked)
- **Conduct Vendor Tastings:** worth 2 gifts when completed, requires 3 total effort. Completing this task additionally grants +1 excitement and immediately satisfies the Key requirement for:
  - *Design Signature Drink* (now unlocked)
  - *Finalize Menu Selections* (still potentially locked until you book any Food and Drink vendor)
  - *Order Wedding Cake* (still potentially locked until you book any Food and Drink vendor) 
- **Create Guest List:** worth 3 gifts when completed, requires 4 total effort. Completing this task additionally grants +1 excitement and immediately satisfies the Key requirement for:
  - *Send Save-the-Dates* (still potentially locked until you book any Stationery vendor)
  - *Mail Wedding Invitations* (still potentially locked until you book any Stationery vendor)
  - *Create Seating Chart* (still potentially locked until you book any Venue)

**3. Wedding Planner Effort (Optional)**
If you've contracted with your Wedding Planner, you have a separate pool of **3 effort** that can be applied to unlocked, non-key tasks. This effort is also tracked on your Wedding Planner card. You may use planner effort at any time on your turn.

> **Example:** 
> Jennifer takes a Plan action. She notices 3 unlocked tasks:
> - *Design Centerpieces* (worth 3 gifts when completed, requires 2 total effort, 1 effort already filled, unlocked by a previous Flowers & Decorations booking)
> - *Host Rehearsal Dinner* (worth 2 gifts when completed, requires a single effort, unlocked by Choose Wedding Party key task previously completed)
> - *Order Wedding Rings* (worth 2 gifts when completed, requires 2 total effort, 0 effort already filled)
> 
> Jennifer applies 1 effort to *Design Centerpieces* (completing it for 3 gifts), 1 effort to *Host Rehearsal Dinner* (completing it for 2 gifts), and 1 effort to *Order Wedding Rings.* She advances her Completed Tasks tracker twice.

---

### Help Action

Draw from one of three shared Help decks to gain resources or bonuses.

**Steps:**

**1. Choose a Help Deck**
Choose one of the three shared Help decks:
- **Money Help** - Provides coins with upside options
- **Effort Help** - Provides task completion support but they can never help on Key tasks
- **Research Help** - Provides vendor acquisition support

**2. Draw and Resolve**
Draw the top card from the chosen deck. Read the card and choose one of the options presented. Resolve your choice immediately.

**3. Place Helper**
Place the helper card face-up in your next available helper slot (1, 2, or 3) on your player board as a reminder that you've used it.

**Helper Limit:** You may have at most **3 helpers** total. Once you have 3 face-up helpers in your slots, you cannot take the Help action again.

**Empty Decks:** Once a Help deck is empty, it remains empty for the rest of the game.

> **Money Help Examples:**
> - "Grandma says she can send you what she has immediately or she can save up and give you more just before the wedding. Take 1 coin now, OR take 3 coins at the beginning of Month 12."
> - "Future In-Laws say they can help a bit now, but they'd be willing to pitch in a bit more once they see (and approve of) the guest list. Take 1 coin now, OR take 3 coins once the *Create Guest List* task is complete."
>

> **Effort Help Examples:**
> - "College Friend says they can help a bit today, but once they wrap up this semester they can help out more. Apply 1 effort to any unlocked task immediately, OR gain 3 effort to use on any unlocked task after the next Check-In."
> - "Maid of Honor would love to help with the bridal shower, but if you have other plans she can help with whatever. Immediately apply effort to complete the *Plan Bridal Shower* task, OR apply 1 effort to any unlocked, non-key task immediately."
 
> **Research Help Examples:**
> - "Foodie Friend knows a couple great places that might work. Reveal the top 2 Food & Drink vendors, keep 1, bottom the other."
> - "Mother-in-Law wants to help but you don't always see eye-to-eye. Choose another player to act as MIL. They suggest a vendor from a category you have not booked yet. Draw the top card from that category. You may keep or discard this vendor. If discarded, they suggest a different unbooked category. Draw the top card from this second category. You may keep or discard this vendor as well. All discarded vendors go to the Featured Vendor Row."

## 6. GAME SYSTEMS

### Theme System

Your wedding's **theme** is the aesthetic vision that ties your choices together. The theme system uses five elements that appear on vendor and venue cards.

#### The Five Theme Elements

1. **Whimsy** (pink spiral) - Playful, magical, whimsical
2. **Edge** (purple lightning) - Bold, modern, unconventional
3. **Nature** (green leaf) - Organic, natural, outdoor
4. **Tradition** (maroon rings) - Classic, formal, traditional
5. **Elegance** (gold diamond) - Luxurious, refined, sophisticated

#### Theme Cards

At setup, you drew 2 Theme cards from the 10 possible themes. Each Theme card combines 2 elements:

- **Classic** (Tradition + Elegance)
- **Bohemian** (Whimsy + Nature)
- **Contemporary** (Edge + Tradition)
- **Eclectic** (Whimsy + Edge)
- **Fairytale** (Whimsy + Elegance)
- **Garden** (Nature + Elegance)
- **Glamorous** (Edge + Elegance)
- **Industrial** (Edge + Nature)
- **Romantic** (Whimsy + Tradition)
- **Rustic** (Nature + Tradition)

At the first Check-In (after Month 3), you'll choose 1 of your 2 Theme cards and place it on your Vision board. This determines which 2 elements are your "theme elements" for Theme Goal scoring.

#### Theme Element Trackers

Your player board has 5 theme element trackers (Whimsy, Edge, Nature, Tradition, Elegance), each with positions 0-8+.

**Gaining Theme Elements:**
When you book a venue or vendor face-up, for each theme element icon on the card, advance that element's tracker by 1.

**Venues** also grant **1 wild theme token** - immediately choose any element tracker to advance by 1 (this is in addition to the printed icons).

**DIY vendors grant no theme elements.**

**Milestones:**
- **Position 2 or 5:** Gain +1 excitement immediately
- **Position 8:** Gain 5 gifts immediately
- No further tracking after position 8 (no additional bonuses)

#### Strategic Implications

The more purely you pursue your 2 theme elements (while keeping the other 3 elements low), the better your Theme Goal score can be. However, this requires careful vendor selection and sometimes passing on powerful cards that could "pollute" your trackers.

---

### Excitement System

**Excitement** represents the buzz and anticipation building for your wedding. As excitement grows, you unlock milestone rewards and accumulate gifts for endgame scoring.

#### Excitement Track

Your player board has an excitement track from positions 0-25. Milestones are at key positions: stir (5), buzz (10), hype (15), roar (20), max+ (25).

Position 25 is a hard cap. If you would gain excitement while at position 25, that excitement is not tracked.

#### Gaining Excitement

**From Bookings:**
When you book a venue or vendor, advance the excitement value printed on the card. The more theme element variety, the more guests get excited about your choices.

**From Other Sources:**
- Theme element tracker milestones
- Key task completion bonuses
- Fallback bonuses (when unable to take certain bonus actions)
- Public goal setting (+1 excitement per public goal)

**DIY vendors grant no excitement.**

#### Excitement Milestones

**Every 5 positions** (5, 10, 15, 20, 25), choose ONE:
- **Gain 1 coin**, OR
- **Draw 1 venue or vendor card** from the venue or any category deck (top card)

**If contracted with your Wedding Planner:** You may draw from the Featured Vendor Row instead of venue or category decks.

#### Endgame Conversion

At game end, your final excitement position converts **directly to gifts**.
- Example: Excitement at position 18 = 18 gifts at endgame

---

### Venues

Venues are the centerpiece of your wedding - the physical space where your ceremony and reception occur.

#### Venue Basics

- **Venue cards are physically larger** than vendor cards
- **The center position on your booking grid is physically larger** to accommodate venues
- Venues **must be booked in the center position** of your 3×3 grid
- You **must book exactly 1 venue** per wedding
- The center position grants the **"Any Action" bonus** when booked

#### Venue Costs & Elements

**Costs:** Venues typically cost 2-4 coins

**Theme Elements:** All standard venues include:
- **Printed theme element icons** (typically 1-3 icons)
- **1 wild theme token** (choose any element tracker to advance by 1)

#### When Booked Effects

All venues have powerful **"When Booked"** effects that trigger immediately when placed:

**Effect Types:**
- **In-House Vendors:** Add unique vendor cards to your hand (not from regular decks)
- **Referrals:** Draw vendors from specified categories
- **Task Completion/Effort:** Auto-complete or apply effort to specific tasks
- **Constraints:** Impose restrictions or requirements

Some in-house vendors also have their own "When Booked" effects that trigger when *they* are booked.

#### Venue Hand Limit

**Before booking a venue:**
- Maximum 5 cards total (vendors + venues combined)
- Maximum 3 venues in hand

**After booking a venue:**
- Must discard all remaining venues from hand by end of turn
- Discarded venues go face-up to Featured Vendor Row

#### Example Venues

**Neighborhood Church** (2 coins, 2 excitement, Tradition + Wild)
When Booked: Take *Church Pastor* (in-house Ceremony vendor, 0-cost, 1 excitement, Tradition) and add to hand. When *Church Pastor* is booked, apply 1 effort to *Plan Ceremony Structure* task immediately.

**Opulent Grand Ballroom** (3 coins, 2 excitement, Elegance + Elegance + Wild)
When Booked: Draw 1 Photography or Entertainment vendor (your choice). Take *Grand Ballroom Valet* (in-house Transportation vendor, 1-cost, 1 excitement, Elegance) and add to hand.

**Whispering Festival Manor** (4 coins, 4 excitement, Whimsy + Tradition + Elegance + Wild)
When Booked: Draw 1 Entertainment and 1 Food & Drink vendor. Add both to hand.

---

### Wedding Planners

Wedding Planners offer professional services that ease the planning process - for a price.

#### Contracting

At setup, you received one of eight Wedding Planner contracts. At any point during the game, **on your turn**, you may pay **3 coins** to contract with your planner.

Once contracted:
- You immediately gain access to all three services
- You cannot un-contract, though you may ignore their services
- The Wedding Planner contract remains visible to track your status and usage of services
- While under contract with a Wedding Planner, your wedding may include at most one DIY vendor.

#### The Three Services

**Service 1: Access**
When you reach excitement milestones (5/10/15/20/25) and choose to draw a card, you may draw from the **Featured Vendor Row** instead of venue or category decks. This gives you more control and visibility into what you're getting.

**Service 2: Coordination**
You receive a pool of **3 effort** tracked on your Wedding Planner card. This effort can be applied to any unlocked, non-key tasks throughout the game (not just during Plan actions). Track usage with a marker/cube sliding along the 0-3 track on the planner contract.

**Service 3: Exclusive Access**
Your Wedding Planner grants access to one unique venue that is not in the regular venue deck. This exclusive venue sits on/with your Wedding Planner contract and is **always available** once contracted. It does not count toward hand limits. You may book it on any turn after contracting.

#### Wedding Planner Exclusive Venues

Each of the 8 Wedding Planners has a different exclusive venue. Examples:

**Destination Wedding** (3 coins, 2 excitement, Nature + Whimsy + Whimsy)
When Booked: Gain +2 Excitement immediately.

**Grand Theater** (4 coins, 4 excitement, Whimsy + Edge + Elegance + Wild)
When Booked: Draw 1 Entertainment vendor. Unlock the *Venue Setup/Teardown* task and apply 1 effort to it.
Constraint: DIY Entertainment may not be booked. If you already have DIY Entertainment booked, this venue cannot be booked.

**Private Island** (4 coins, 4 excitement, Edge + Nature + Elegance + Wild)
When Booked: Unlock the *Coordinate Guest Arrivals* task and apply 1 effort to it.
Constraint: Transportation vendors may not be booked.

---

### Moments

Moments represent the actual wedding ceremony and reception highlights captured in time. They are **spatial patterns** on your 3×3 booking grid.

#### Moment Structure

At setup, 3 Moment cards were revealed from the 16 total. Each Moment shows:
- **Thematic name**
- **Pattern:** Which grid positions must be filled (and which must be empty)
- **Size tier:** Small (S), Medium (M), or Large (L)
- **First completer reward:** typically 3-5 gifts
- **Card back (subsequent completer reward):** typically 1-3 gifts

#### Moment Scoring

**Check after EVERY booking action** (including bonus bookings):
- If your grid pattern **exactly matches** a revealed Moment, score it immediately
- **Exclusive patterns:** Positions marked "must be filled" must have vendors/venues, and positions marked "must be empty" must be empty

**Same-Month Rule:**
Everyone who completes a Moment on the same month number get first completer value. After that month ends, flip the card to show reduced subsequent value.

Example: Month 5, both Player 1 and Player 3 complete "The Aisle" → both get 3 gifts. After Month 5 ends, flip the card. Future completers get 1 gift.

## 7. CHECK-INS

After Months 3, 6, and 9, everyone pauses for a **Check-In**. This is when you set goals and prepare for the next quarter.

**There is no Check-In after Month 12** - the game proceeds directly to endgame scoring.

### Check-In Structure

Perform these steps in order:

**1. Move All Meeples to Vision Boards**
Everyone moves their meeples to their Vision boards in order to Check-In.

#### Part 1: Set Goals

**2. Set Theme (First Check-In Only)**
At Check-In 1 (after Month 3), you must choose 1 of your 2 Theme cards and place it in your Vision board (face-down to keep it private, or face-up to make it public and immediately gain +1 excitement). This determines your 2 theme elements for Theme Goal scoring. Discard the unchosen Theme card face-down.

**3. Set a New Goal**
Choose 1 goal you haven't set yet (Theme, Budget, Excitement, or Guest) and place it in your Vision board:
- **Check-In 1:** Set first goal (any of four types)
- **Check-In 2:** Set second goal (different type from first)
- **Check-In 3:** Set third goal (one of two remaining types)

You may set each goal **face-down (private)** or **face-up (public)**:
- **Private:** No immediate benefit
- **Public:** Immediately gain +1 excitement

You may flip private goals to public later, but you do NOT gain excitement if you flip them after the Check-In.

#### Part 2: Preparation (Reset for Next Quarter)

**4. Clear Featured Vendor Row**
Discard all face-up cards from the Featured Vendor Row to the bottom of their respective category decks.

**5. Pass First Player Token**
Give the First Player token to the next player clockwise.

**6. Reveal New Featured Vendors**
The new first player chooses 5 distinct categories and reveals 1 card from each category face-up in the Featured Vendor Row.

### Check-In Complete

Play continues with the first player starting the next quarter.

## 8. GOALS

Goals represent the personal vision and priorities you set for your wedding. Over the three Check-Ins, you will set exactly **3 goals** - one per Check-In.

### Goal Types

There are **four goal types**:
1. Theme Goals
2. Budget Goals
3. Excitement Goals
4. Guest Goals

Since you set 3 goals over the game, you will skip one goal type entirely (your choice).

### Private vs. Public Goals

When you set a goal, choose:
- **Private (face-down):** No immediate benefit
- **Public (face-up):** Immediately gain +1 excitement

You may flip private goals to public later, but you do NOT gain excitement if flipped after the Check-In.

---

### 1. Theme Goals

Theme Goals evaluate how well you pursued your 2 theme elements.

At endgame, look at your theme element trackers and compare:
- Your **2 theme elements** (shown on your chosen Theme card)
- Your **3 non-theme elements**

**Unforgettable - 30 gifts**
Only your 2 theme elements have progress. All other 3 elements are at position 0.
*Example: Theme is Classic (Tradition + Elegance). Trackers: Tradition=7, Elegance=5, Whimsy=0, Edge=0, Nature=0.*

**Thematic - 20 gifts**
Your 2 theme elements are the only top 2 elements. No ties with non-theme elements for the top 2 positions.
*Example: Theme is Classic (Tradition + Elegance). Trackers: Tradition=6, Elegance=5, Whimsy=3, Edge=2, Nature=1.*

**Coordinated - 15 gifts**
Both of your theme elements are in the top 2 positions. Ties are allowed.
*Example: Theme is Classic (Tradition + Elegance). Trackers: Tradition=6, Elegance=5, Edge=5, Whimsy=1, Nature=0. Tradition is in top 2. Elegance is tied for top 2.*

**Subtle - 10 gifts**
At least one of your theme elements is in the top 2 positions.
*Example: Theme is Classic (Tradition + Elegance). Trackers: Tradition=6, Whimsy=5, Edge=4, Elegance=3, Nature=2. Tradition is in top 2.*

**Bonus: Balanced (+5 gifts, orthogonal)**
If your 2 theme elements are exactly equal at game end, gain +5 additional gifts. This stacks with any tier achieved above.
*Example: Theme is Classic (Tradition + Elegance). Trackers: Tradition=5, Elegance=5, Whimsy=3, Edge=1, Nature=1 → Coordinated (15) + Balanced (5) = 20 gifts total.*

### 2. Budget Goals

Budget Goals evaluate the cost distribution of your booked vendors. **DIY vendors do not count** (they are 0-cost and create their own plurality bucket).

At endgame, count how many vendors you booked at each cost tier (1-cost, 2-cost, 3-cost). Whichever has the most (plurality) determines your score.

**Extravagant - 15 gifts**
Most of your booked vendors cost 3+ coins.

**Refined - 10 gifts**
Most of your booked vendors cost 2 coins.

**Modest - 5 gifts**
Most of your booked vendors cost 1 coin.

**Ties go up:** If you have equal numbers at multiple tiers, score the highest-value tier among the tied tiers.
*Example: 3 one-cost, 3 two-cost, 2 three-cost → Refined (10 gifts).*
*Example: 3 one-cost, 3 two-cost, 3 three-cost → Extravagant (15 gifts).*

---

### 3. Excitement Goals

Excitement Goals evaluate the excitement distribution of your booked vendors.

At endgame, count how many vendors you booked at each excitement value (1-excitement, 2-excitement, 3-excitement). Whichever has the most (plurality) determines your score.

**Spectacular - 15 gifts**
Most of your booked vendors grant 3+ excitement.

**Vibrant - 10 gifts**
Most of your booked vendors grant 2 excitement.

**Intimate - 5 gifts**
Most of your booked vendors grant 1 excitement.

**Ties go up:** If you have equal numbers at multiple tiers, score the highest-value tier among the tied tiers.
*Example: 3 one-excitement, 3 two-excitement, 2 three-excitement → Vibrant (10 gifts).*

---

### 4. Guest Goals

Guest Goals evaluate booking multiple vendors from a specific category.

At Check-In, choose one of these 9 Guest Goals:
- **Admired:** Photography vendors
- **Amazed:** Flowers & Decorations vendors
- **Captivated:** Entertainment vendors
- **Honored:** Stationery vendors
- **Impressed:** Attire & Accessories vendors
- **Indulged:** Food & Drink vendors
- **Moved:** Ceremony vendors
- **Pampered:** Favors & Gifts vendors
- **Spoiled:** Transportation vendors

*(No Guest Goal for Venue - you must book exactly 1 venue.)*

**Scoring at endgame:**
- **3+ vendors** in chosen category: **15 gifts**
- **2 vendors** in chosen category: **10 gifts**
- **1 vendor** in chosen category: **5 gifts**

Awards provide additional ways to score 5 gifts each.

## 10. END OF GAME

After everyone completes Month 12, the game ends. **There is no Check-In after Month 12.**

### Final Steps (Before Scoring)

**Convert Excitement**
Your final excitement position converts **directly to gifts**. Take that many gift tokens.
*Example: Excitement at position 18 = 18 gifts.*

### Scoring
By this point, everyone has already received gifts for excitement, task completion, moments, and the race award.

**Theme Goals:** 10-30 gifts (+ 5 if balanced)

**Guest Goals:** 5-15 gifts

#### 2. Awards

## Designer Notes

The Wedding Planner began as a love letter to the wedding planning process - the overwhelming task lists, the hunt for the perfect vendors, the tension between vision and budget. After three years of brainstorming, design, and development and more than a hundred hours of playtesting, the game has evolved into a medium-weight euro that celebrates weddings in all their forms.

Special thanks to our playtesters, whose feedback has shaped every system. To the couples who shared their wedding stories. To everyone who sees themselves in this game.

May your wedding - in cardboard or in life - be filled with joy, laughter, and love.
